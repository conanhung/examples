        In order to improve accuracy of the OCR functionality, there are a number of things you can do taking the picture of the puzzle:
        <ul>
            <li>Take the picture upright, fill as much of the screen as possible with content of the puzzle. Do crop the input image when necessary;</li>
            <li>Maintain even lighting on surface of the sheet, and avoid sharp shadow;</li>
            <li>Unwrinkle the sheet and clean up spots, as noises significantly reduce accuracy;</li>
            <li>Do use the Numpad to correct wrong OCR guesses in Preview screen;</li>
            <li>Don't try weird input cases, because you probably will win; </li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
