        <p>Sudoku Resolv is yet another Sodoku game for the iPhone. It's not a small crowd, but this is very different from any other Sudoku games in the App Store -- you can't play it!</p>
        
        <p>With this utility, you can take a picture of a Sudoku puzzle that is on a piece of paper, open an existing image from the Photo Album, or even from the iPhone Clipboard that you have Copied while surfing the web, the App can recognize the puzzle and extract existing hints off the photo, then proceed to solve it. Because the OCR capability is not bullet proof, you will have a chance to review the OCR result and make corrections as necessary.
